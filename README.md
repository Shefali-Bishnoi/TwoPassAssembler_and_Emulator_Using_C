# TwoPassAssembler_and_Emulator_Using_C
This repository contains a C-based assembler and emulator. The assembler converts assembly code to machine code, handling label resolution, mnemonic parsing, and operand validation, with error handling and logs. The emulator simulates code execution, offering a step-by-step processor simulation for learning and debugging.
